# Hermes App

Modern React/TypeScript app for the Hermes video downloader, built with Vite, TanStack Router, and shadcn/ui.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm 8+ (recommended package manager)

### Installation

```bash
# From the project root
pnpm install

# Or from the hermes-app directory
cd packages/hermes-app
pnpm install
```

### Development

```bash
# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Type checking
pnpm type-check

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Preview production build
pnpm preview
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:5173

## 🔧 API Integration

### Type Generation

Hermes uses **automatic TypeScript type generation** from the backend API's OpenAPI schema:

```bash
# Generate types from running API (requires API server running)
pnpm generate:types
```

**Development Workflow:**
1. Backend API changes are made
2. Run `pnpm generate:types` with API running on localhost:8000
3. Generated types in `src/types/api.generated.ts` are committed
4. Frontend gets full type safety for all API calls

**How it works:** FastAPI automatically serves OpenAPI JSON at `http://localhost:8000/openapi.json`

**Current State:** Uses auto-generated types in `src/types/api.generated.ts` (2,937+ lines)

**✅ Working:** Run `pnpm generate:types` to update generated types with full automation
